# Teach2Give Technical Test Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to the Teach2Give Technical Test questions. Each question is solved using Python programming language.

#  Questions
1.	FizzBuzz: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz"; for multiples of 5, print "Buzz"; and for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
2.	Fibonacci Sequence: Write a program to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to 100.
3.	Power of Two: Write a program that takes an integer as input and returns true if the input is a power of two.
4.	Capitalize Words: Write a program that accepts a string as input, capitalizes the first letter of each word in the string, and then returns the result string.
5.	Reverse Integer: Write a program that takes an integer as input and returns an integer with reversed digit ordering.
6.	Count Vowels: Write a program that counts the number of vowels in a sentence.
